## About me

 *I am from Ukraine, Zaporizhzia. I am confident to say that I am excellent at accurate science. In addition, I always try to achieve my goals. However, I would say that my greatest talent is communication with people, ability to resolve disputes and give peace. I am always amazed when people are unable to reach an agreement or understand each otherâ€™s opinion or look at the problem from the other side. I am fond of team-working. I find it enjoyable to come up with new ideas. Nowadays, my dream is to create my start-up in the field of IT business in Ukraine.The motto of the lyceum where I studied: "The road will be mastered by walking" this means that to achieve the goal, you need to move and not give up if difficulties arise along the way. I decided that this motto will be the slogan of my whole life, so I believe that if I put in enough effort, I can conquer the peaks.*
